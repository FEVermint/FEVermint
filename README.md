## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Tobi, a passionate developer from Aachen.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building a robot that can make perfect pancakes every morning.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to communicate with cats using Morse code.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a project to create the world's first hoverboard for dogs.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the time I accidentally turned my kitchen into a science lab.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Send a carrier pigeon with a note attached to its leg.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can recite the entire script of "The Lion King" backwards. Not.
